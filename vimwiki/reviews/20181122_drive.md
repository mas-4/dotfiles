Nicolas Winding Refn’s _Drive_
==============================

I am hereby commencing an attempt to decode the colors of the film _Drive_. I
will therefore list the time, color, and theoretical meaning of the color.

| Time   | Color                          | Meaning                           |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1:42   | yellow                         | caution                           |
| 1:57   | red                            | danger                            |
| 2:21   | yellow/blue                    | caution? safety in the shop       |
| 3:18   | orange                         | caution                           |
| car    | silver                         | boring?                           |
| 8:12   | yellow-orange                  | caution                           |
| 9:44   | blue                           | safety                            |
| titles | pink                           | style? I don’t know               |
| 10:31  | pink, yellow, green            | dominant emotions of film?        |
| 11:40  | red sweater                    | DESIRE                            |
| 11:57  | yellow outside green inside    | caution outside safety within     |
| 12:32  | blue > green > yellow          | boring > safety > caution         |
| 17:45  | blue/green apartment           | safe                              |
| 18:12  | red                            | danger (the girl, for him)        |
| 18:51  | white                          | purity (what Gosling loves)       |
| 19:20  | green                          | safe (leaving the apartment)      |
| 20:18  | red                            | danger (mob bosses)               |
| 22:00  | blue/green bg, shirt           | NOT safety; idk                   |
| 22:30  | blue/green shirts, jackets     | organized crime?                  |
| 34:25  | red face (husband coming home) | DANGER                            |
| 36:00  | red apartment (total)          | DANGER                            |
| 36:00  | green/blue aparment (dark)     | safe, lonely, boring, sad, _blue_ |
| 41:00  | red coffee mug                 | sipping from a cup of danger      |
| 62:28  | blood on face green room       | in danger even in safe space      |
| 73:00  | Carey in green, Ryan in orange | Complete role reversal            |

I’m done with this analysis for the rest of the movie. If I see something
significant, I might write it down. So far, this is what I’ve seen:

- warm colors are dangerous, cool colors are safe

| color  | meaning |
|--------|---------|
| red    | danger  |
| yellow | caution |
| orange | caution |
| green  | safe    |
| blue   | boring  |

But there was an analysis I read that had almost the exact opposite analysis,
which I don’t see. Because these colors have very recognizable meanings and
archetypes, which my analysis has hewed to, including red meaning
danger/desire/passion, green (typically) meaning envy, blue meaning safe, yellow
and orange meaning caution.

So IDK.

The most incredible scene in the entire film is that elevator scene. It is so
blatant with the colors and lighting that you couldn’t mistake it for anything
_but_ intentional. Eros and thanatos. The permanent human state.

What interesting music for the hit. Showtunes. Also the fact that he wears a
celebrity mask. A bit more meta-statement about celebrity, cinema, and violence.
The revolving lighthouse light also seems highly intentional. Why, I can’t say.
Perhaps the strobe of a projector.

Refn loves strobing red across his actors faces, especially when he spells
danger.

That YouTube analysis about the color is retarded.

He has a shot of their shadows, as they stab each other, that is straight
Grecian pottery, a combat tableau.

What an incredible film.

The music reminds me so much of college. Chillwave was taking over the indie
scene at the time. I was into the party scene, the neon colors, flashing lights,
electrohouse before it was called edm and packaged for celebrities and the
radio by jackass morons like Dr. Luke.

I love that about this film. I came to it just a little too late. (It came out
after my downfall, but only just.)

The ending was exactly as it should be. There _should absolutely under no
circumstances whatsoever_ have been a reunion scene. Instead, there was a
distance scene. Carey Mulligan knocking on the door of Ryan Gosling, getting no
answer; Ryan Gosling driving around a curve, then a straightaway, cut to black.

As I recall, the only names in the film were of people the audience shouldn’t
like. Nino. Standard. I don’t remember the name of Bryan Cranston, but I think
we may have heard that. I don’t remember the name of Nino’s partner, but I think
we heard that. No, scratch all that. Benicio, the kid, we learned his name. The
names were highly selective anyway.

Great film.

Now to the other Refn film.
