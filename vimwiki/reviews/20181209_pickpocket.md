Robert Bresson's _Pickpocket_
=============================

I am beginning to _get_ Bresson. I want to get _L'Argent_, but I am starting to
appreciate how profoundly literary this director is.

I will say, right off the bat, he is a profoundly selfish director, wanting all
of the accolades for himself. He steals the emotion from his actors and puts it
into his film himself. He could probably make a brilliant film with actors like
Paris Hilton and Vin Diesel.

He is also utterly obsessed with the subjects of deliverance, mercy, and
freedom. This film, from the start, was heavily reminding me of 19th century
existentialism. We have a Dostoevskian _Notes from the Underground_ element and
an Ubermenschian Nietzschean element. The main character has a large element of
self-loathing. I keep getting a sense of Camus' Meursault from Bresson's lead
characters. They have a willful subversion of expected morality. Fontaine in _A
Man Escaped_, perhaps, fits the least with this motif, and yet, the only reason
we see him as moral is that he is escaping from Nazis; obviously Balthazar
himself does not fit with the motif, but the dark haired young man that causes
his death certainly does. In _Pickpocket_ it comes across the most clearly.

I'm still at a bit of a loss for discussing this film in depth. I will be
watching the commentary, perhaps I will discuss it more tomorrow.
