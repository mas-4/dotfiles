----------------------------

I have recently begun a reinvestigation of Histoire(s) du cinéma (the actual
study, not the film by Godard). I have just been throwing myself back into
watching art house films, is really what I’m saying. It sort of started with two
events: one, me watching _The Witch_ on Netflix and adoring it, and two, me
finding some cheap blurays on Amazon that my father and I watched (the Jack
Ryan series and the Bourne series). Partway through this, though, I had the
inclination to watch David Lynch’s _Dune_, so I ordered it, and watched it. I
then found myself wanting to watch John Carpenter’s _The Thing_, one of my
favorite films, so I ordered that. From there, I spiraled out of control. I have
been wanting to reacquire two Criterion films I lost due to my brothers’
ransacking of my movie collection: Godard’s _Breathless_ and Gillo Pontecorvo’s
_Battle of Algiers_. When I went to order them, though, Amazon suggested some
Kurosawa and Bergman films. Since I’ve heard so much about those two, I decided
I’d be better off ordering something I’ve never seen. I got the first four films
listed below.  All excellent. (I picked _Mishima_ because I’d seen it years ago
at a Philosophy grad student’s house and wanted to watch it again.) From there I
purchases Kubrick’s _Barry Lyndon_ because I saw some interesting discussions of
it’s cinematography on Youtube. Then _Solaris_ because--you know, at this point,
I don’t know how I pick out movies. But I’m right now ordering what I’m most
itching to watch. I have especially been seeking out Criterion Collection worthy
movies. Over the past several weeks I have watched (not in actual order, except
within source):

1. Akira Kurosawa’s _Throne of Blood_ from Criterion
    - Incredible adaptation of _Macbeth_; probably the most interesting
      performance of Toshiro Mifune I’ve seen yet. Some shots--the swaying trees
      as Spider’s Web Forest comes to Spider’s Web Castle, Lady Macbeth
      shuffling out of a room, even the eerieness of the witch in the
      beginning--are absolutely haunting. Perhaps most fascinating to me was
      seeing the genesis of the beautiful fog shots in the beginning of Justin
      Kurzel’s _Macbeth_, which I regard as better than the critics seem to
      (especially _The New Yorker_).
2. Ingmar Bergman’s _The Seventh Seal_ from Criterion
    - This was a fascinating film. I have not ordered any more Bergman yet
      because I’m still debating springing for the Bergman collection of 39
      films coming out on November 20. This film, however, was fascinating. Bibi
      Andersson as Mia was divine, Nils Poppe as Jof was...I cannot find words
      for his performance, Gunnar Björnstrand was a study in cynicism as Jöns,
      and heading the case, Max von Sydow was really fascinating. The
      Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy between Antonius Block and Jöns was
      interesting to watch. And the scene where Antonius gives up the game (and
      thus his life) to distract death from Jof and Mia’s escape was quite
      touching. I’d have to say I loved the film, even if I didn’t understand
      all the symbolism, which is one of my largest complaints about the
      Criterion bluray, as the commentary provides more narration than
      explanation!
3. Paul Schrader’s _Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters_ from Criterion
    - This film is quite fascinating. I still don’t know completely what to make
      of it. It’s incredibly moving. The Temple of the Golden Pavilion was a
      rather interesting and moving sequence (despite my inital irritation at
      the extravagance of the character’s stutter); Kyoku’s House was rather
      peculiar, though interesting from a Freudian standpoint (plus, Hario
      Siphon coffee!); Runaway Horses was a little two militaristic for me
      (though, that _is_ what Mishima is all about), but I especially loved the
      way the plot was discovered (with the walls breaking away); and finally,
      the final chapter, was a study in grandiosity and disappointment. That
      said, the final chapter was particularly moving in its conclusion: the
      actual Seppuku was beautiful. Strange word to apply, bit it was. Sublime
      is, perhaps, more accurate.
4. Akira Kurosawa’s _Rashomon_ from Criterion
    - I liked it. Despite my initial reticence at its seeming very
      fifties-TV-ish (the form and plot seem very much out of a TV show episode;
      that being the result of it’s having been copied over and over and over
      again) it had an incredibly poignant ending. The Woodcutter is a beautiful
      character.
5. Stanley Kubrick’s _Barry Lyndon_ from Criterion
    - Incredible cinematography. The story is fun, too, but I will admit, I
      began to get restless in the second half. You certainly don’t walk away
      from the film _liking_ Barry. All that said, however, I’ve always loved a
      good Picaroon, ever since I read Stephenson’s Baroque Cycle.
6. Akira Kurosawa’s _Seven Samurai_ from Criterion
    - Holy crap is this rightly considered Kurosawa’s masterpiece. I don’t know
      what it is, perhaps the epic length and refusal to foreshorten the story
      until it’s fully developed, but it is _not_ just an action flick like the
      typical Westerns it inspired. I am nervous about investigating other
      Samurai films for this precise reason: simple fun stories are not what I
      am looking for in a film. The plot of _Seven Samurai_ may very be simple,
      but the storytelling is most certainly not.
7. Andrei Tarkovsky’s _Solaris_ from Criterion
    - I don’t know how much I liked this one. I mean, I certainly _did_ like it,
      Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari was angelic and frightening, the sort of
      character that induces you to recognize humanity in robots. And the film
      successfully completes its mission: to make you understand that nostalgia
      is consuming, that even when you know the memory is not the thing, you
      cannot escape from it. But there were aspects that failed, in my opinion.
      Some of the storytelling was jumbled, especially the memories of Kris
      toward the end (perhaps that is the point). The concept of the ending was
      itself brilliant: that he has completely given himself over to the
      nostalgic memory rather than escape it to the real world, _but the
      execution was flawed_. I did not like the cheesy 70’s effects. I can
      sometimes forgive them, but I thought Tarkovsky could have found a more
      effective method for conveying the same idea without resorting to hackey
      film cuts. Especially because he’s brilliant _at precisely that sort of
      thing_. The initial traffic sequence was genius at conveying the dystopian
      future.
8. Olivier Assayas’s _Après mai_ on Hulu
    - Titled _Something in the Air_ in English, it was a lovely film (not
      jaw-dropping, mind you, but lovely nonetheless). I couldn’t agree more
      with the sentiment: didactic art and ideological struggle are culturally
      dead. That is why L’Esprit du Mai died after May 1968: it turned overtly
      ideological in a way the actual May movement was spontaneous and
      fascinating (even the Debordian ideology). The film also has a fascinating
      use of fire and fade cuts. They were significant. I have interpreted the
      use of fire to convey the ephemerality of youth and passion. I base this
      on the burning of the characters’ best art. First, India Menuez’s
      character Leslie tries to burn Alain’s best art, which she doesn’t succeed
      in, and second, Gilles burns Laure’s favorite painting of his because “it
      was only for her, and now no one else must see it.” Other uses of fire:
      the burning of Laure’s poetry book titled _Gasoline_, :wink: :wink:, the
      burning of the room Laure is in after her last appearance in the film
      (when Gilles burns her favorite painting), and the explosion of the car in
      the final act. Also, toward the beginning, the characters throw molotov
      coctails. Fire is a pervasive motif in this film.
9. Robert Eggers’ _The Witch_ on Netflix
    - Beautiful cinematography, and in incredibly eerie film. I especially loved
      the ending with Black Phillip. You just don’t know what to make of all the
      witchcraft until that scene. Though, and apparently the director has
      pointed this out, the inital opening shot with the old haggish witch
      cutting up the baby is _supposed_ to make very clear from the get go that
      witchcraft is very real in this film.
10. Denis Villeneuve’s _Enemy_ on Netflix
    - Brilliant thriller. Villeneuve definitely has a style with his score,
      though, that I think might get repetitive if he continues to use the same
      foreboding sound. It’s very industrial and minimalistic. I don’t know how
      to describe it except jarring. He’s used it in _Enemy_, _Sicario_, and
      _Blade Runner 2049_. _Arrival_ I think had it too, but _Arrival_’s
      soundtrack was awesome for the Richter. The spiders in _Enemy_ are driving
      me nuts.
11. Steven Knight’s _Locke_ on Netflix
    - I was nervous starting this film, that it would be mediocre and try hard.
      It was definitely not. It is an incredible statement of integrity and
      virtue in the 21st Century.
12. Alfonso Cuarón’s _Y Tu Mamá También_ on Netflix
    - Wow. Did not realize that film was going to be so good. Charolastra for
      life. Was very saddened, not by Luisa’s ending, but by Julio and Tenoch’s.
      One of the most brilliant aspects of the film is how subtly they convey
      the inequality of Mexico. The characters are so carefree about
      _everything_ and yet you constantly see the Mexican police harrassing poor
      people on the sides of the road. And the story of Chuy’s life after the
      film takes place is heartbreaking. You have a real sense of ephemeral
      paradise.
12. Wes Anderson’s _Grand Budapest Hotel_ on Bluray
    - Fantastic Anderson film. I often find it hard to read much into the film
      besides a delightful stylistic story. I know _Royal Tenenbaums_ is about
      family, as is _The Darjeeling Limited_, and, I guess, even _The Life
      Aquatic_, but I rarely recognize _symbolism_. The birthmark in the shape
      of Mexico on the face of Soairse Ronan seems like nothing more than the
      randomness of Wes Anderson’s mind.
13. Alfonso Cuarón’s _Gravity_ on Bluray
    - Honestly, this film was okay. I mean, in the scale of movies, it’s up
      there, but in the scale of films, it’s not. It is a better _The Martian_,
      which sucked, honestly. I’m not the biggest fan of Sandra Bullock, to be
      honest. But she performed admirably. The largest issues I have with the
      film are useless cavalier scientific inaccuracies: for instance, George
      Clooney zipping around the shuttle with an _EMERGENCY_ jet pack,
      untethered to anything. That simply doesn’t happen. They had
      semi-realistic portraits of the difficulties of space navigation, but they
      did absolutely nothing for orbital mechanics, and wildly underplayed the
      difficulty of much of it. I know this isn’t quite a criticism of the drama
      itself, but honestly, if Cuarón had simplified the action of the plot so
      that the scientific inaccuracies weren’t looming, I would have enjoyed the
      drama much more. I _thought_ the film was going to be a “room drama,” a
      single setting film, and I think it would have been slightly more
      effective that way. But hey, I’m a snob, so fuck off.

If there are some I am missing it is because I have watched so many in the last
two to three weeks. I took a trip to Sound Exchange and purchased four or five
films, including two Criterions: Gus Van Sant’s _My Own Private Idaho_ and
Stanley Kubrick’s _Spartacus_. (I also purchased _Patton_ and _Das Boot_.) I am
also sitting on two recent Amazonian purchases: Andrei Tarkovsky’s _Stalker_ and
Akira Kurosawa’s _Ran_. I will be watching these in the next few days. I just
ordered (as of this morning) two Jean Cocteau films: _Beauty and the Beast_ and
_Orpheus_.

I have been watching a fifteen part documentary on Hulu called Mark Cousins’
_The Story of Film: An Odyssey_. It is quite good, though Cousins’ voice can
grate with its melodramatic cadence. Regardless, I have learned quite a bit
about the history of film already (I am in episode six). From it I have become
interested again in French Cinema, which is why I ordered the two Jean Cocteau
films and I am itching to order Michael Carné’s _Les Enfants du Paradis_.

Most ironically, I still have yet to purchase _Breathless_ or _Battle of
Algiers_. I will, though, eventually.

Regardless, this git repo will serve to be a collection of reviews I will begin
writing now as I watch these films. Tonight I will be watching Tarkovsky’s
_Stalker_. I am rather excited about it after watching a filmmaker talk about it
on the criterioncollection Youtube channel.


Sun Oct 28 08:49:18 EDT 2018
----------------------------

I found two good Youtube channels: criswell and Art Regard. Both are concerned
with art and cinema.

I watched Jean Cocteau’s _La Belle et La Bête_’s, reviewing now.


Wed Oct 31 16:42:26 EDT 2018
----------------------------

Since last README entry I have watched and reviewed _Orpheus_ and am two thirds
of the way through _Stalker_. I will be finishing _Stalker_ tonight and
reviewing either tonight or tomorrow.

This README will serve as a journal entry. No. I’m going to rename this file and
generate a new README.

I have acquired Michel Carné’s _Les Enfants du Paradis_. I will be watching that
in the next few days. Also: Kurosawa’s _Ran_.

I am still contemplating my next Criterion purchase: I am considering the
following six films:

1. François Truffaut’s _The 400 Blows_
2. Vittorio de Sica’s _Bicycle Thieves_
3. Robert Bresson’s _Pickpocket_
4. Robert Bresson’s _Au Hasard Balthazar_
5. Federico Fellini’s _La Dolce Vita_
6. Andrei Tarkovsky’s _Andrei Rublev_

I was initially very eager to get _Andrei Rublev_ but I am hesitant now. I am
struggling to get through _Stalker_ (review coming soon). There isn’t even a
commentary on the bluray! I have no doubt I will eventually watch _Andrei
Rublev_ but I don’t know that I will order it next (I am hereby limiting myself
to one film a week; we’ll see how long that lasts). I am inclined to continue my
French kick with _The 400 Blows_ or _Pickpocket_. I am very eager, however, to
see _Au Hasard Balthazar_. Bresson is supposed to be amazing, so I want to see
both of them. I am also very eager to see _Bicycle Thieves_ and _La Dolce Vita_
(and eventually _8 1/2_) but I do not know that it is time to start in on
Italian cinema yet. I was initially contemplating Carl Dreyer’s _The Passion of
Joan of Arc_ but I _know_ I am not ready for silent films yet.

Will keep this journal posted. Renaming it to journal.md now.


Sat Nov 10 22:17:10 EST 2018
----------------------------

Clearly, I’ve watched _Andrei Rublev_. I am about to press play (it’s far to
late in the night to finish it) the 205 minute version.

I have also pre-ordered Criterion’s Bergman’s Cinema Collection, which will be
coming in in a few weeks. I purchased, and have yet to watch (save the first
twenty minutes) _Children of Paradise_. I will watch it soon enough.

I am not purchasing any more Criterion films for the rest of the month. I’m
trying to save a little money and I have plenty of films to watch already,
between the 40 or so films I have in my list on Netflix, the ten or so on Hulu,
a couple on HBO Go, and the five or six I’ve purchased on blu ray and haven’t
watched yet, I’ve got some movie watching to do. Once I get Bergman’s cinema, I
won’t need to buy any for a while (though I will). I’m getting more and more
curious about Italian cinema, though I still feel the need to continue in my
French cinema before I get to Italian. Specifically, Bresson, Truffaut, and
Godard. I also kind of want to watch _And God Created Woman_. Bridgette Bardot
was hot as hell.


Tue Nov 13 08:01:00 EST 2018
----------------------------

While I wait for my 39-film Ingmar Bergman collection (I’m so excited!) I
decided to start blowing through all the films in my Netflix, Hulu, Amazon
Prime, and HBO Go watchlists. First up is Kogonada’s _Columbus_.


Fri Nov 16 09:16:50 EST 2018
----------------------------

So, watched another Assayas film, and reviewed it. I started watching Scorcese’s
_Silence_ before that but had to give it up because the film needs an LED
television screen. On my 15 year old LCD the blacks are so badly represented the
film is hard to see. It appears to be one of highly subtle coloration and it’s
not getting a good representation on this screen, so I’ll wait.

My lists on Netflix and Hulu are getting huge and fascinating. The films I most
want to watch on Netlfix are:

- _The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_
- _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_
- _The Third Man_
- _The English Patient_
- _her_
- _The Duchess_
- _Under the Skin_
- _Tulip Fever_
- _L.A. Confidential_
- _Once Upon a Time in America_
- _Boyhood_
- _The Immigrant_
- _Mudbound_
- _Woman in Gold_
- _The Founder_
- _Room_
- _Free State of Jones_
- _Slow West_
- _The End of the Tour_
- _Only God Forgives_
- _Spring Breakers_
- _The Other Side of the Wind_
- _Suite Française_
- _Raw_
- _It Follows_
- _Lion_
- _A Most Violent Year_
- _My Golden Days_
- _Veronica_
- _In Darkness_
- _Brick_
- _Life_
- _The Bad Batch_
- _Mohawk_
- _Beasts of No Nation_
- _The Endless_
- _Colonia_
- _Prodigy_
- _Salt and Fire_
- _As I Lay Dying_

And on Hulu:

- _Silence_
- _Blow Out_
- _Ain’t Them Bodies Saints_
- _Frank_
- _Lucky_
- _Let the Sunshine In_
- _The Duke of Burgundy_
- _Mulholland Drive_
- _Raging Bull_
- _The Hero_
- _What’s Eating Gilbert Grape_
- _The Pianist_
- _Midnight in Paris_
- _Moonrise Kingdom_
- _Colossal_
- _Ingrid Goes West_
- _Mother!_
- _Young & Beautiful_
- _Goodbye First Love_
- _Marguerite & Julien_

These films are in no particular order, merely the order in which I see them in
my list. And on Amazon:

- _Deliverance_
- _The Age of Innocence_
- _Badlands_
- _One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_
- _Jeremiah Johnson_
- _The Count of Monte Cristo_
- _Breakfast at Tiffany’s_
- _The magnificent Seven_
- _Excalibur_
- _Chapter 27_
- _Cosmopolis_
- _A Ghsot Story_
- _The Neon Demon_
- _American Pastoral_
- _Goya’s Ghost_
- _The Lost City of Z_
- _Manchester by the Sea_
- _The Machinist_

But there is no way I’ll make even a dent in all this before I’m suddenly awash
in 39 Ingmar Bergman films in a week.

I’m also highly interested in getting into Bresson and Ozu. I seem to see them
referenced often by filmmakers who interest me. And their influence seems
unfathomably interesting.

Wed Nov 21 10:12:36 EST 2018
----------------------------

Alright, I got all the Bergman films. I also just got _Breathless_.

The Bergman collection is organized into a film festival. I was thinking I'd
start with all the centerpieces and work my way to the more obscure films, but
since watching _Wild Strawberries_ back to back with _Summer with Monika_ in a
double feature and seeing how obviously they explore similar themes, I am
inclined to stick more to Criterion's selections. As such, I will continue to
explore these summer films.

Sun Nov 25 15:17:51 EST 2018
----------------------------

I ordered Ozu's _Tokyo Story_. Will watch tomorrow. I think I'm going to start
_Scenes From a Marriage_ this afternoon. It seems not to be restored like some
of the other films. There's a ton of film grain. I would rather watch the
television version than the theatrical version; though I am bothered by the
lack of restoration, as I was with the 205 minute version of _Andrei Rublev_. Oh
well.

I have watched three Nicolas Winding Refn films in the last two days. I have
also watched Jon Turtletaub's _The Meg_ (what a piece of shit that was) and
Alejandro González Iñárritu's _The Revenant_. Also, Andrew Byrne's _In
Darkness_. A lot of films in a couple of days.

Wed Nov 28 18:30:11 EST 2018
----------------------------

I watched _Tokyo Story_ and reviewed it. I just purchased 3 Bresson films: _Au
Hasard Balthasar_, _A Man Escaped_, and _Pickpocket_. I actually feel like
watching none of them tonight, so I will watch _Citizen Kane_ and review
tomorrow.
