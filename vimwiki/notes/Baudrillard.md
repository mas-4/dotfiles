- I wonder if Baudrillard realizes what Simulacra and Simulation really are:
  base-level human impulses and methods of perception: in short, _archetypal
  perception_.
- This opening quote sums up best his misunderstanding: simulation is a process,
  to him, whereby a representation of a thing consumes the thing itself until it
  is the mere simulation, which the representation has become, because
  representation requires a referent, which has ceased to exist. The opening
  paragraph here details how omnipresent and omnipotent this process really is.
  Just as in Society of the Spectacle, _there is no escape from this process_,
  no matter what. Even the Borges allegory, itself initially a symbolic
  representation of the simulation process itself, has been sumbsumed into a
  simulation, as Baudrillard sees it.
    - Well fuck, Baudrillard, can’t you see the unverifiability of your problem?
      This is just like psychological egoism:
        - Everything one does is out of selfishness.
        - What about selfless acts?
        - Even those.
        - How?
        - You enjoy performing selfless acts. Therefore you perform selfless
          acts for the enjoyment, which is selfish. Therefore there are no
          selfless acts.
        - Well that’s just tautalogical.
    - Exactly.
- The allegory:

>...the decline of the Empire witnesses the fraying of this map, little by
>little, and its fall into ruins, ___though some shreds are still discernible in
>the deserts___—the metaphysical beauty of this ruined abstraction testifying to
>a pride equal to the Empire and rotting like a carcass, being confused with the
>real through aging...

- This is important. This is where we get:

>It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the
>deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. _The desert of the
>real itself_.

- Ah, Morpheus.
- Realize you not, _M. Baudrillard_, that it is _because the desert is not worth
  representing_ that it is all that remains of the real? That it is never
  simulated?
- Simulation is as necessary to the reality of humanity as water. Without
  representation, and eventual simulation, _we would never build a better
  civilization_. The thing must be represented, and then abstracted, _and then
  done away with altogether_ to build something better.
- That is appalling. As you will see later in the notes.

>...it is difference that constitutes the poetry of the map and charm of the
>territory...

- Yeah, but everything is great in the beginning and sucks at the end. THAT IS
  THE WAY OF ALL FLESH. Even Dubstep was cool in the beginning. But then it’s
  nothing but dumbfucks and Dubstep isn’t cool and smart anymore, it’s just a
  simulation of what it originally was, which was real representation of human
  creativity. It happened with Drum ’n Bass (eventually you got Pendulum, which
  killed it) and from Punk we got Hardcore (gross).
- All kidding aside, if Baudrillard thinks this process is something that can be
  repulsed, Baudrillard is Holden Caulfield. He believes the innocence of
  childhood can be preserved in amber. _But it rots, M. Baudrillard_. That is
  why Peter Pan is fiction, and a man child is a wasted life.

>It is a hyperreal, _produced from a radiating synthesis of combinatory models in
>a hyperspace without atmosphere_.

- I love the French, but they are so full of shit sometimes. C’mon, dude. That’s
  a practically meaningless sentence. I am often accused of using $50 dollar
  words where $5 ones would work, but you did that on purpose.

>...a programmatic, metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all
>the signs of the real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes.

- That short-circuiting is itself necessary to progress! You are Rousseau, _M.
  Baudrillard_. You are railing against civilization. I understand the anger.
  Modern society has many pratfalls. _But to rail against this short-circuiting
  is to rail against civilization itself_.
- Many people that experience war first hand often wish they could go back and
  experience the same primal humanity, the comerarderie and love (for war is
  nothing if it is not _sexy_), ___but no one would ever willingly return to
  war___. It is only Achilles and the insane. Just the same, ___we will not, and
  should not, return to our primal beginnings prior to representation: for that
  is Peter Pan, and that is rotten innocence, and death___.

>“Whoever fakes an illness can simply stay in bed and make everyone believe he
>is ill. Whoever simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms”
>(Littré).

- I would _almost_ say that this is a distinction without a difference, though
  it really does have a difference, but I have yet to see you make any use of
  it.
  
>...if any symptom can be “produced,” and can no longer be taken as a fact of
>nature, then every illness can be considered as simulatable and simulated, and
>medicine loses its meaning since it only knows how to treat “real” illnesses
>according to their objective causes.

- Please see the Wikipedia for _deepfakes_, and the coming death of truth and
  reality in American politics (which may have been dead in all reality since
  11/9, the Post-9/11 9/11.
    - It really is kind of interesting that 11/9 is the inverse of 9/11,
      considering how significant both days are in the slow-moving trainwreck
      that is 21st century America.

>What can psychoanalysis do with the duplication of the discourse of the
>unconscious in the discourse of simulation that can never be unmasked, since it
>is not false either?

>“If he is this good at acting crazy, it’s because he is.” ...all crazy people
>simulate, and this lack of distinction is the worst kind of subversion.

- Of God and idolatry:

>...their metaphysical despair [the iconoclasts] came from the idea that the
>image didn’t conceal anythign at all, and that these images were in essence not
>images, such as an original model would have made them, but perfect simulacra,
>forever radiant with their own fascination. Thus this death of the divine
>referential must be exorcised at all costs.

- Yes, _M. Baudrillard_, but there is a distinction between idols and simulation
  that you neglect to _truly enunciate_ and that is: their was never a
  representation which became a simulation at all, only simulation, for the
  referent never existed in the first place. The simulation of God was all there
  ever was, in contrast to Borges map, which once represented land.

>All Western faith and good faith became engaged in this wager on
>representation: that a sign could refer to the depth of meaning, that a sign
>could be exchanged for meaning and that something could guarantee this
>exchange—God of course. But what if God himself can be simulated, that is to
>say can be reduced to the signs that constitute faith? Then the whole system
>becomes weightless, it is no longer itself anything but a gigantic
>simulacrum—not unreal, but a simulacrum, that is to say never exchanged for the
>real, but exchanged for itself, in _an uninterrupted circuit without reference
>or circumfrence_.

- This chain of logic in the previous two quotes works _only_ if you realize
  that God itself is a symbol of what religion is: the divine nature of man that
  can be unlocked through patient self-discipline and sacrifice. This divine
  nature can be enunciated in multiple ways, perhaps enumerated in multiple
  facets, but ultimately comes down to what might be classed as two separate
  results of the same principle:
    1. The Golden Rule
    2. The Interconnectedness of All Things
- Together these two facets of religion are the whole of God, the whole of the
  divine nature of humanity, _where we define humanity as something achieved,
  not born_.
- Given all this, that mean that the icons that the iconoclasts smashed were
  simulations of a simulation: namely, the retarded developments of people
  re-ifying the symbols which represent our two principles. The Gospel of Thomas
  is the most pure gospel, in that it is clearly a set of koans meant to help a
  person understand these divine principles on a deeper level, _to grok them_.
  Textual analysis (philology) says that Thomas is the earliest Gospel, and
  quite possibly _Q_, the source of the other gospels. Those gospels are clear
  reifications of Thomas. Which themselves are re-ified in Paul’s epistles. _The
  way of all symbols is to become the things themselves_. This is good in some
  places and bad in others _but it is a tale as old as humanity: further layers
  of abstraction_, which is exactly what is happening with software right now:
  software is so abstracted we have to use containers.

- I should get my terms right now, and forgive any previous confusion of these:
    - Simulacra is the representation without referent
    - Simulation is the act of creating the representation without referent

- This is about to as close to valid criticism of the simulacra as I’ve seen so
  far. He’s criticizing disnification (disney-ification?). Disnification _is_
  pernicious, but M. Baudrillard is overly obsessive. Much of this book reads
  like a very sophisticated hipster crying “FAKE! FAKE! That’s just not
  authentic, _man_.” I thoroughly understand the reason this stuff was so
  powerful in the sixties (oh, shit, actually it was published in 1981!), but it
  seems so much to me like posturing, _itself_ inauthentic. It is absolutist and
  uncompromising: does he see no value in the modern world? We’ve eliminated
  the majority of diseases and causes of early death, we’ve eliminated much of
  the causes of miscarriage and early childhood death, we’ve virtually
  eliminated poverty in comparison to what it was in the 1800’s. _This
  Rouseaudian hatred of modernity is backwards_.
- It is always remarkable to me how much leftists are the same as reactionaries.
  We’re currently living through one of those times like the 1930’s where
  reactionary and leftist forces do battle and centrists and technocrats have to
  hide. 
- _The world progresses, accept it_. This is the grand human problem. _Life
  changes, accept it_ to be more exact. _You can never step into the same
  river twice_. There are three ways to react to this fact:
    1. ___Reject that it is happening___ and fight all indication that it is,
       seeking to rip time backward into the past. This is the way of
       reactionaries. They recognize change as invalid. They see no positive
       change whatsoever. The Old Way was right. The “New Way” is an abberation,
       an abomination, fit only to be erased. Thus the Nazis sought to eliminate
       all “decadent” culture, instituting an idealized, _false_ simulacra of
       former manhood and society. Thus the Trump movement seeks to revert
       America to a pre-sixties world, where minorities and women know their
       place and the white working class _had factory jobs_.
    2. ___Accept that it is happening, but fight it anyway___. This is the way
       of leftists _not progressives_. Progressivism is a misnomer when applied
       to modern leftist movements: _Bernie Sanders is not progressive, he is
       leftist_. Progressivism has been ham-fisted in the past (see, 1900-1920
       progressivism, which had Bernie-esque ham-fisted reforms), but it did not
       seek to HALT change. That is what Leftists do. They seek to halt and
       control change through wealth redistribution and heavy financial
       regulation. Because they accept that change is happening, they accept
       some forms of change, and sometimes encourage more change _in certain
       directions_. Thus they see diversity as a good thing. But they cannot
       accept the lack of control and changing economy. They cannot accept
       change that _demands change of them_. And a changing economy does just
       that. We must adapt or die to changing economies. Thus the progressive is
       as against globalization as the reactionary. But where the reactionary
       focuses in their propoganda on changing social mores, the leftist focuses
       on economic criminality. I would probably say the reactionary only reacts
       to change when his livelihood is threatened and he must adapt
       economically, but that the reaction itself manifests as being against
       changing social mores, but this seems to be speculation. I am literally
       performing this analysis as I write, so this distinction only became
       apparent now. One thing worth noting is that _in its most pernicious
       form, leftism seeks to halt all growth_. Literally, there are leftist
       movements to end growth. Zero-Growth they call themselves. They claim to
       believe in it to prevent environmental disaster and climate change, _but
       it is change itself they seek to halt_.
    3. ___Accept it and adapt___. This is the true way of progressivism, the
       true way of conservatism, and the true way of liberalism. The true way of
       democracy. It’s always struck me as peculiar that idealized liberalism
       and conservatism _are not mutually exclusive philosophies_. Progressivism
       is not a true political persuasion, it is just direct intervention
       liberalism. Perhaps we can just define these as three separate
       persuasions of reaction to change.
        1. Conservatism: a belief that change can come too quickly and cause
           negative results. It is an _instinct_ according to Edmund Burke, but
           it can be formulated thus: change too fast ignites reactionary and
           leftist passions _which never yield positive results_. Thus while the
           Conservative accepts change, he believes it must be controlled. The
           classic archetype of Conservative change is the Glorious Revolution
           in 16- what, 89? 92? I can’t remember: it found the need to revolt
           _precisely_ because rights found in the past were being rejected in
           the present. Conservatism often engages in a creative rewriting of
           history: a conservative _knows_ that the past does not include those
           rights, but by culturally rewriting history to _include_ those
           rights, we can progress, because then the progress is rooted in the
           past. Britain has always found progress through the expansion of it’s
           former rights. It does not postulate and philosophize rights into
           existence, it finds them in jurisprudence, pragmatism, and precident.
           It _will_ stymie change if the change will come too soon: thus the
           famous Anthony Trollope story of the liberal that rejects a
           progressive proposal that he believes in because he accepts that
           society is not ready for such a massive change. The personification
           of a conservative is an elder statesman who has seen enough to know
           better than the liberal.
        2. Liberalism: a belief in the future and the progress of history, an
           acceptance of change, and an active eagerness to see it happen. Thus
           they get excited about technology and progress. They will be happy to
           see the changes that the reactionary fears. A liberal overestimates
           logic and reason, so he will idealize a positive future and thus
           ignore the possibilities of negative outcomes of positive change THE
           FALLOUT OF WHICH WE ARE LITERALLY DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW.
           Specifically, the positive change of globalism and automation
           resulted in the negative outcome of massive unemployment among the
           working classes. Thus the reactionaries and leftists are out and
           about and roaring right now (though possibly also being chastened by
           the negative results of their efforts: well, the reactionaries are,
           because Trump is so bad, but the leftists are getting stronger;
           either one wins and we all lose). The archetype for liberal change is
           the French revolution: the bourgeoisie part, that is, in the
           beginning, from 1789-1792 when philosophers were in charge and not
           the proletariat. That was when they were modelling themselves on the
           Americas, but they were philosophizing rights into existence.
           Liberalism is autistic: liberal revolution ignores human passions in
           an effort to see the ideal world brought about. Thus Voltaire, et al.
           were in charge of a revolution that saw the destruction of both the
           clergy and the nobility. Britain never destroyed either (well, Henry
           VIII sort of did, but that’s irrelevant), they simply adapted them.
           Thus _they still have a royalty, however meaningless it is_.
        3. Progressivism is an active effort to bring about the future. Where
           liberalism is excited to see it happen, progressivism imposes it. I
           am hesitant to call progressivism healthy, but I can work with it.
           You see, progressivism often delves into leftism, a kind of
           totalitarianism, thus Prohibition, a fundamentally progressive effort
           of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Antitrust operations can
           also be seen to be delving into leftism. But I am hesitant right now
           to call it leftism. Or, rather, I believe some of these more active
           progressive measures can sometimes be employed to positive results:
           right now, specifically. We _need_ anti-trust legislation. We _need_
           big change. Because while Liberalism sits around and watches change
           and Conservatism is content to slow it down, when the liberals win
           for a period of time and society changes too much and is not ready
           for it _it is necessary to throw oneself into the future_. Thus, in
           response to (a) terrorism, (b) the economic protections eroded by the
           Great Recession, (c) automation, and (d) hyper-connectivity—all
           results of change that has come about _perhaps not too rapidly_ but
           rather while society sat idly by in the false belief that the model
           in existence for the past 70 years would properly integrate all
           change—society must make massive changes, it must _rebuild_ the Post
           War world for a new one formulating now. That is why I cannot call
           Progressivism Leftism. Leftism rejects Change. Progressivism sees it
           and believes in making major changes to society to properly integrate
           society into it. Thus Anti-Trust, Social Security, Public Schooling,
           Government-backed Construction Efforts (e.g., the highway system,
           public utilities, wire-laying, etc.), and New-Medium Regulations
           (i.e., the television regulations of the thirties, the CDA of the
           90’s, etc.)
- As should now be obvious, Baudrillard is a Leftist afraid of change. _He
  regards all change as inauthentic_. He might very well be a Leftist of the
  Zero-Growth variety. I can see no “Path Forward” in his criticism of society.
  Only complaint. Society of the Spectacle is similar. So we have, on a scale of
  reaction to change:

```
Reactionary        Leftist        Conservative        Liberal        Progressive
<------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
Rejection                                                             Acceptance
```

- Let’s apply Baudrillard’s representation -> corruption -> simulacra process to
  currency. What does currency represent? Or, as Baudrillard’s ideology has it,
  what _did_ currency represent that it has now subsumed? Easy, _value_.
    - If currency once represented value, (a) what was value and (b) how did
      currency replace it?
    - If I am M. Baudrillard, I’d say that value is desire. An object has value
      insofar as society desires it. Currency represents an abstraction of value
      such that value _itself_ can be traded. Then, currency itself becomes the
      thing valued, and value itself is corrupted.
    - In honest analysis the invention of currency was a master-stroke for
      society. Anyone can see that it lubricates human interaction and exchange
      of value. Bartering is a nightmare for any economy beyond a few hundred
      people. You cannot have divisions of labor without abstracted value. Of
      course, Marxists believe divisions of labor are inherently alienating _but
      therein is the Rousseaudian trap_: to reject divisions of labor is to
      reject growth. It is to shout _“BACK TO NATURE!”_ and strip off one’s
      clothes.
    - What can be said is that the _fact of currency’s representative nature_
      becomes obscured. People begin to value currency rather than what currency
      represents, which is a means to value. Of course, why do we value things?
      That is difficult to answer. But clearly, it would be better for everyone
      if the representational nature of currency were to stay in the front of
      our minds. _But would it, really?_ It is because we see money as an end
      unto itself that we have things like joint stock companies and venture
      capitalists. The machines of finance are abstractions built upon
      abstractions. The problem lies not in _too much_ abstraction, but _too
      fast_ abstraction, i.e., abstracting before the abstractions can be
      properly integrated in society. This is why CDO’s and ARM’s were so
      disastrous to the economy: they were shoddy abstractions built too fast
      with too little thought outside of greed.

- Mass shootings. I rejected this logic at first but then saw it: it is not that
  the truth of one interpretation or another is not borne out by facts at the
  end, it certainly is, _but what does it fucking matter in the end_? We see
  each mass shooting as one of a number of possible things, and we make bets in
  our head based on certain details: the shooter has a middle eastern name:
  clearly the work of “Radical Islamic Terrorism” and the right begins to make
  conclusions in their arguments and blame the left; the shooter is white and
  the victims were black: clearly, alt-right racism, and the left does the same.
  But in reality: nothing changes. What, is this tallied up? It doesn't matter!
  Every time there's a shooting _we run through all the possibilities in our
  head and so the act is itself an act of every possibility_. If we were honest
  to God interested in _preventing_ such acts, we wouldn't care what each
  individual act actually was, _we would only rely on statistical analysis_, but
  in reality, we're just interested in the simulacra of healthy public debate:
  we're interested in the one-up-man-ship of massacres. Was the gun legally
  bought or not? Was the shooter white, middle eastern, black, liberal,
  conservative? What was the motive? _ALL OF THESE THINGS_. Because it can be
  any of these things and no one event actually changes the political logic of
  our response to it. Well, theoretically it could, but it hasn't yet, and there
  isn't really any reason to suspect that it ever will.
- I am not entirely convinced that Baudrillard doesn't realize that his
  conception of capital may very well be a simulacra. It certainly is a
  difficult abstraction. Marxists, according to Wikipedia, define capital
  strictly as money which is used to make more money. If that is the case, then
  Baudrillard (and most Marxists) certainly seem to lose track of their
  definition quite often.
